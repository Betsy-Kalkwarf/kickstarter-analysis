# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
First bootcamp assignment - noticing trends in Excel
Louise wants to fund her play and is looking into the success/failure of previous Kickstarter campaigns

Kickstarter Campaign Project

Overview of Project
Louise needs help with her Kickstarter project. She wants to know what aspects of a Kickstarter campaign are more likely to lead to success. She has provided data about many Kickstarter campaigns including information like start date, financial goal, country, and type of campaign. This project, utilizing Excel, will analyze the given data to help Louise plan a successful campaign.

Analysis

Multiple aspects of the given Kickstarter campaign data was analyzed to see what might have an impact on the success of a campaign. When looking at the launch date, both the number of campaigns and percentage of campaigns’ successes were analyzed, seen in the files Outcomes by Month and Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.

In the file Outcomes vs Goals you will see the success of a campaign based on its financial goal.

Challenges

I tried to complete this challenge after only one class. I struggled with Deliverable 2 because I was inserting a pivot table and creating a pivot chart, instead of just creating a chart (learned in the second class.) I just had to play around with the different settings until I was able to create the desired graph.  I also struggled with getting the goal ranges in order. Setting ascending or descending didn’t work with ranges. I had to figure out how to manually move them around. 
There were also instances where I didn’t turn off filters from previous steps. This adjusted the data and charts I created. I noticed that my output didn’t match what was in Canvas. I then had to go back  and clear filters.

Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
The best time to launch a campaign is going into summer. December was the only month when the percentage of successful and failed theater campaigns were almost the same.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with goals under $20,000 were more likely to be successful. Above $20,000, the potential for success was all over the place. Above $45,000 also was very likely to be successful, but there was a lot less data for campaigns that high so conclusions are less solid.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
The types of Kickstarter campaigns carried a lot. This is helpful when looking at Kickstarter campaigns, in general. For Louise, comparing the variety of types of campaigns when she was only interested in theater could lead to misleading information. Also, we weren’t given specifics on how the campaigns were run or planned for. Both of those things can have a big impact on their success.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could look at success of the different parent categories. This could help Louise decide if a Kickstarter campaign is a good option for theater. We could also look at how long a campaign lasted and how much of its goal was funded.
